# To start GRASS use the StartGRASS.sh script
# Make sure grass64 is located in your PATH 
# because grass64 will be started 

./StartGRASS.sh

#type "./StartGRASS.sh grass62" if you want to start grass62

# The test suite works like all other grass scripts, 
# g.parser is used to parse the command line
# and a tcl/tk gui will created automatically 
# if the test suite is started without parameters and 
# if its located in your addon path

# Befor the general and vector test can be run, make sure the database paths
# are set correctly. To asure this, start the test suite with option "-d" first

./RunGRASSTestSuite.sh -d

# the output should look like this

Mapset <testmapset> in Location <TestLocation>
